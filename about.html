         <h2>Our Story</h2>
         <p>Ethereal Eve Creations | Est. 2021</p>
         <p>Ethereal Eve Creations was founded in 2021 by Thando Nkosi, with a passion for celebrating the beauty, versatility, and uniqueness of Black women's hair.</p>
         <p>We believe that hair is more than just a style — it's your crown, your story, and your power. Protecting your hair doesn't mean you have to hide it.
             At Ethereal Eve Creations, we encourage you to confidently flaunt your beauty while nurturing your natural locks.</p>

         <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
         <p>We provide a wide selection of beautiful, affordable hair options in various colors and styles. 
            Whether you're looking for everyday convenience, protective styles, or something bold and fun — we've got you covered. Looking fabulous shouldn't break the bank.</p>
         <p>As a full-time student in my early twenties, I quickly realised how expensive beauty and hair care can be.
             That's why we're dedicated to offering affordable, quality hair that fits your budget.</p>
